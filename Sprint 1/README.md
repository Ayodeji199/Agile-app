The front end team had chosen to finish the questionnaires feature while the backend team stuck to working on the database and login system.

## Day 4 - Thursday - Scrum meeting summary

### Members Present:
All team members were present

### Members Not Present
None

### Apologies:
None

### Summary:
The team was a bit unsynchronised as some members hadn't shown very collaborative agile methods of work. This was due to out of working hours additional work by some members which wasn't communicated fully with the team. This caused some feedback from some team members as it was opposing to the principals of agile and while the workflow had been quite low at the start of the sprint the respective work was kept throughout it until this point.
- What was accomplished the previous day: Front end team had finished majority of the tasks they had attached to them for the day with minor difficulties. The backend was coming together way better now as it was being finished and build into the system. The questionnaires story we had planned for this week was actually coming in to a close as we were getting into day 4.
- Are there any impediments in your way: Minor issues with mostly software and language difficulties in front end development and also a short discussion for the situation described in the summary of the day which was used to just establish that the action was slightly negative to members of the team. With our team able to resolve this issue quickly with understanding from both sides after discussing what was actually done.
- What are you working on today: Complete specific stories if we are able to and then review teams work over the sprint, scrum master and product owner are going to be preparing for the upcoming meeting with the stakeholders
