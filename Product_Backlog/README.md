# Product Backlog
This is Group 7's backlog. From here you can access all our backlog links that are related to the product we are developing.

The template used for each board is as follows:
> Each of the following are made of multiple columns each representing the value of the stories put in the columns.
> The "General Prioritization" board is automatically generated with just 4 stories which were moved manually as our team wasn't satisfied with their initial placement.

#Labels
Labels were created by our team to assist us in tracking the key functionalities related to each story.
