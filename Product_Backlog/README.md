# Product Backlog
This is Group 7's backlog.
We took a different method to the backlog, instead of using an excel table we chose to use the "issues" in github as our stories and combined that with the associated labels to them we can use github to access our entire planning at any point without having to use a different software or file to look them up or reference to. As a further addition to our planning we decided we will use github's issue structure to add the tasks we perform by adding comments with tasks we have indicated mandatory to count a story as done.

To review our backlog you can navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/Group-7-AC31007/Group7-AC31007/issues) tab. If you would also like our evaluation of stories and preparation work are included on the bottom of this page with their links accordingly. 

# Labels
Each of our stories in the [Issues](https://github.com/Group-7-AC31007/Group7-AC31007/issues) will have several labels attached to it.
- a story point label (typical format: *sp)
- a label used for organising similar stories or with a common objective
