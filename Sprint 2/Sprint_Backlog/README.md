# Sprint 2 Backlog
Similar to our product backlog we are using a more unique version of a sprint backlog. We decided to use a "project" on GitHub to display our sprint 2 backlog. We created a GitHub project that displays what stories we are working on during the sprint and what the progress of each is or in what step of the process they are. We chose this over an xlsx file as we find it really handy to have the sprint backlog displayed in a very easy to understand fashion and allow some GitHub features to assist in organisation.

### Access the sprint-2 backlog [here](https://github.com/Group-7-AC31007/Group7-AC31007/projects/7).

The associated sprint-2 burndown chart is demonstrative of the work carried out by the development team but to carry more weight as to what work was completed every day it will be far more valuable to review GitHub's issue commits. (The daily scrum meetings also recorded which stories were worked on daily, with relevant links to the stories/issues)

# Structure:
- 4 columns to make the project board representing if a story is in the backlog, worked on, waiting on review or completed.
- Story points related to each story is shown as a tag
- **additional information:** if you inspect the stories on GitHub, you can see what tasks were assigned to each story as being worked on by the development team and what tasks were done.
