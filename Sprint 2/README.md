## Day 1 - Scrum Meeting summary

### Summary of Conversation:
Similar to the start of sprint 1 this was used as a general brainstorming session between team members to adjust to the picked sprint backlog.
However we used this time better than the previous sprint as now we already had set the ground goals for this print better and we knew how each member of the team could perform. As we had carried out the sprint retrospective at the end of the last week, the product owner and scrum master addressed what was noted and planned to improve for this scrum sprint. After that was discussed the product owner displayed what stories are going to be covered this sprint. Stories were assigned to specific members of the development team and so the work day began on a good note with everyone in understanding of the task presented to them.
